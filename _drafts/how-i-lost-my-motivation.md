People often admit to being prolific, if perhaps not proficient,
artists in high school. I was no different. Class was my most
productive time - I placed myself strategically at the back, hoping my
teacher would think I was frantically taking notes on 19th century
French literature and not doing crude drawings of video game
characters.

In college my output slowed down, but after graduation I decided to
get more serious about drawing. I had been completely self-taught
- aside from a one-page feature in Amazing Spider-Man on how to draw
hands like Mark Bagley - but now it was time to learn to draw
“properly”. So I bought some drawing books, rolled up my sleeves (a
necessary precaution against graphite stains) and got to work.
Initially things went well. I did studies, exercises and still lifes
as the books prescribed, but just as I started to improve something
unexpected happened: I stopped drawing. I had lost my motivation.

I tried habit-building techniques, joining a study group and buying
new art supplies (has that ever worked?), but no matter what I tried
I couldn’t seem to keep drawing for more than a couple of weeks. But
then something changed. I was listening to an episode of the Pencil
Kings podcast where the host was giving advice on how to get back into
art: “When you start to get serious”, he said, “you start to get hard
on yourself. You risk losing the element of fun. If you love Ninja
Turtles, why not draw Ninja Turtles? What’s forcing you to only draw
nude figure studies?” I paused the podcast and started thinking - when
was the last time I had drawn something just for fun? I couldn’t
remember. Had I lost my motivation because I was practicing too hard?

As an experiment, I put aside my drawing books and started drawing
only from imagination. This turned out to be harder than expected;
I had been focusing so much on what I should draw that I had lost
touch with what I actually wanted to draw. Thinking back to what
I used to draw in high school was a good exercise - it turned out that
the 31-year-old me enjoyed drawing video game characters just as much
as the 13-year-old me.

Bit by bit, I managed to rehabilitate my “fun drawing” muscle, and as
the fun came back to drawing so did my motivation. I’m not saying that
you should give up on deliberate practice, but there needs to be
a balance between the two. Drawing from imagination has actually made
me more motivated to study because it highlights gaps in my knowledge;
if I’m drawing a character and I can’t get the arms right, then I know
I need to study more anatomy. And once I’ve studied anatomy, I know my
reward will be arms that look more like arms and less like thick
spaghetti.

Nathan Aardvark summed it up nicely in a recent blog post:

Learning to draw is hard, and not always fun. In fact, it's often so
frustrating that people just give up. We have to balance the learning
with the 'funning'.  We have to have fun drawing if we hope to make
any progress.
 - Nathan Aardvark

A lot of drawing intro courses for beginners say you should start with
line, some say you should start with studying shapes. I say hold off
on that for a second and ask yourself if you truly care for what
you’re drawing. If not, maybe it’s time to turn to your 17-year-old
self for advice?
